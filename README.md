<br><br>
For example:
<br>If the file name is TestFile1.txt with text Jack said, “Hello Pune”. The output to the file TestFile2.txt should be Jack said,\“Hello Pune\”.

- [ ] 5. Assume that there is a folder (directory) by name “root”. This folder has some files and some subfolders. Each subfolder in turn may have files and subfolders. Write a program to lists all the files inside all the folders/subfolders along with their absolute path.
